Emprical Anaysis Of Sorting Algorithm in Java Language

In this project,I designed an experimental study for the comparison of the
following sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort with
Lomuto & Hoare partitioning, and Heapsort.
I implemented each of the sorting algorithms in Java. I also designed the experiments
for the comparison of all algorithms both theoretically and empirically. I wrote a
detailed report including the pseudo-code of the algorithms, the time complexity of the
algorithms, the experimental design, and my results. I provided some plots to illustrate my results.
I wrote many Java classes for implementing the sorting algorithms and a Main.java class that tests each implemented sorting algorithm for different input
types and sizes.
